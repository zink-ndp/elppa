== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to create just conversations instead of forms?  =
You can create simple text conversations with this addon by using the HTML elements to dislay your responses. The adoon does not yet support Conditional responses. We plan to add that feature soon. But for now, you can create linear conversations.

Once you have created a form using the Conversational form builder you can add it to the ChatBot start menu from the WPBot Settings->Start Menu. Make sure to always Save the ChatBot Start menu settings after rearranging the columns.


= Where will the Conversational form emails go?  =
You can set recipient different email addresses for different emails from the form builder. If no email address is set, conversations will go to the email address you set in the WPBot general settings.

= How do I change the form name =
You can change the form name from the Form Settings tab inside the specific form builder.

= I changed the form name but the Start menu label has not changed  =
Please go to the Start Menu from the WPBot settings and save it again with or without changing anything

A pro version is coming soon, which will allow this feature
